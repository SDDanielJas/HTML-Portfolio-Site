<h1>Favorite Restaurant</h1>
<h2>Outback Steak House</h2>
<p>Outback steak House is my favorite restaurant becuase the food is great! Even though it's a bit expensive it's totally worth it espically if you are celebrating a special occasian.</p>
<h2>Favorite Food Form Out Back</h2>
<h3>Burger With Cheese Fries</h3>
<p>I am a very simple guy. I like the simple things in life like a good burger. Outback always makes a perfect burger cooked to prefection. Also, their fries are awesome but get them loaded with cheese and bacon and they are even better!</p>
<h2>My Review of Outback</h2>
<p>Outback is great and the employees are very nice. You will always feel at home and the food is great.</p>
