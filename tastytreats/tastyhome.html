<h1>Top 3 Tasty treats!</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>What is something every creature on earth has in common? They all need to eat in some way shap or form. For this activity I decided to make three pages that have to do with food. The first page listed is all about my favorite recipes. The secound page has all my favorite packaged food. Packaged food is all the good food you buy at the store. The final page is all ab out my favorite restaurant. This portion of my portfolio is devoted to chapter 6. Where the class learned how to link pages together! This gives our webpages a very professinal look. This will also be the the first webpage published on Bulter's web sever! </p>
