<p>Welcom to my profolio of projects I have created for HTML &amp; CSS class. I love to create things that look good and have a purpose as you can see through my projects presented in the links below.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hello, My name is Daniel, but evertone calls me Danny!</p>
<p>I love to be a create! I use several mediums to create whatever I please, these art forms include; videos, writing, drawing, painting, and coding. The first few mediums seem self-explanatory but not the last one (coding). Coding is actully my favorite medium. Not many people seem to know all they can use it for, you can create; websites, games, and even visually appelaing art work. That's why I go to school for coding. Currently I'm a full time student at Butler Community College majoring in software development. I have one sister named Hannah, she is one of my best friends. </p>
